# The-Litany
This is an Android application designed to loop a single video on any device with OS ranging from 2.1 to 6.0.

It was originally developed for [The Litany](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/SophiaAlMaria), a video installation by Sophia Al-Maria at the Whitney Museum of Art, but it can (and should!) be used by anyone!
